        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Crypto trading always happens in pairs. You exchange one currency for
          another — for example, trading Bitcoin for U.S. dollars or Ether for
          Bitcoin. Understanding how these pairs are quoted and what they mean is
          essential before placing a trade.
        </p>
        <h2>Base Currency vs. Quote Currency</h2>
        <p>
          Every trading pair is written as two ticker symbols separated by a
          slash — for example, <strong>BTC/USD</strong> or <strong>ETH/BTC</strong>.
          The first currency is called the <em>base currency</em>. It’s the asset
          you are buying or selling. The second is the <em>quote currency</em>,
          which tells you how much of that currency you need to buy one unit of
          the base currency. In foreign exchange markets, this format is
          standard; the base currency appears first and the quote currency
          second【933224771719519†L284-L340】.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in the CAD/USD pair, the Canadian dollar is the base
          currency and the U.S. dollar is the quote currency. If the pair is
          quoted at 1.25, it means it costs <strong>1.25&nbsp;USD</strong> to buy
          one Canadian dollar. If the quote moves higher, the base currency is
          strengthening relative to the quote currency【933224771719519†L320-L344】.
        </p>
        <h2>Major and Minor Pairs</h2>
        <p>
          On cryptocurrency exchanges, some pairs trade with higher liquidity
          than others. Pairs that include widely used fiat currencies such as
          U.S. dollars, euros or Japanese yen — for example, <strong>BTC/USD</strong>
          or <strong>ETH/EUR</strong> — are known as <em>major pairs</em>. These
          markets tend to have tighter spreads and deeper order books because
          more traders participate. Pairs that involve less‑traded fiat
          currencies or two cryptocurrencies (such as <strong>ADA/BTC</strong>) are
          called <em>minor pairs</em>. They can be more volatile, and the bid–ask
          spread may be wider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common currency codes you’ll encounter include USD for U.S. dollars,
          EUR for euros, JPY for Japanese yen, GBP for British pounds, CNY for
          Chinese renminbi, AUD for Australian dollars, CAD for Canadian dollars
          and CHF for Swiss francs【933224771719519†L308-L319】. Knowing these
          abbreviations will help you quickly interpret any trading pair.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Read a Trading Pair</h2>
        <p>
          Reading a trading pair involves understanding the quoted exchange
          rate. If you see EUR/USD&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.55, it means that one euro
          costs <strong>1.55&nbsp;USD</strong>【933224771719519†L355-L365】. Traders
          buy a pair when they think the base currency will rise relative to the
          quote currency, and sell the pair when they expect the base currency
          to weaken【933224771719519†L343-L346】.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crypto exchanges also list pairs without a slash, such as
          <strong>ETHBTC</strong>. The convention remains the same: the first
          currency (ETH) is the base currency, and the second (BTC) is the quote
          currency. Make sure to confirm which asset you are buying and which
          one you are using to pay.
        </p>
        <h2>Choosing Which Pair to Trade</h2>
        <p>
          When selecting a trading pair, consider your base currency. If your
          account is funded with U.S. dollars, major USD pairs like BTC/USD or
          ETH/USD will usually have the most liquidity. Also pay attention to
          volatility and fees: minor pairs can move sharply, which presents
          opportunity and risk. Some exchanges offer cross‑crypto pairs (such as
          SOL/ETH) that allow you to trade altcoins directly without converting
          back to fiat first. Understanding liquidity and your risk tolerance will
          help you select the right pair for your strategy.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Mastering the basics of trading pairs is a foundation for any crypto
          trader. By knowing which currency is the base and which is the quote,
          understanding how pairs are quoted and being aware of major versus
          minor markets, you can make more informed trading decisions. Always do
          your research before entering a trade and remember that markets can be
          volatile. Managing risk and staying informed will serve you well as you
          navigate the world of cryptocurrency markets.
