      <p>Cryptocurrency is <strong>decentralized digital money</strong> used on the internet. Unlike national currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate through a distributed ledger called <em>blockchain</em>. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2008 and ushered in a new era of peer‑to‑peer electronic cash. Since then, thousands of coins – including Ethereum, Tether, Solana and Cardano – have been created【384638050843612†L161-L168】.</p>
      <p>The market has expanded dramatically; there are now more than <strong>16,000 cryptocurrencies</strong> in existence【384638050843612†L172-L178】. Their values vary widely. Bitcoin, the largest by market capitalization, was worth nearly US$900 billion in early 2022, while Ethereum’s market cap was under US$500 billion【384638050843612†L172-L178】. Estimates placed the total crypto market around US$3 trillion at that time【384638050843612†L172-L179】. This proliferation of digital tokens means investors must research each project’s purpose and technology before committing money.</p>
      <p>What makes cryptocurrencies unique is their ability to let people transfer value online without a central counterparty. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger and settled within minutes, day or night. Enthusiasts argue that crypto offers privacy, security and irreversible transactions that traditional money cannot match【384638050843612†L184-L188】. Yet the <em>volatility</em> of digital assets is striking: for example, the price of Bitcoin surged from about US$30 000 in mid‑2021 to nearly US$70 000 later that year, only to fall back to around US$35 000 in early 2022【986811852637599†L92-L100】.</p>
      <p>This volatility means cryptocurrencies can be thought of both as a medium of exchange and as a speculative investment. They may serve as a store of value, a unit of account and a medium of exchange, but they also present the possibility of significant gains or losses【384638050843612†L191-L206】. A retiree seeking stable income might avoid such fluctuations, while a younger investor could view crypto as a high‑risk, high‑reward component of a diversified portfolio【384638050843612†L191-L206】. Digital tokens also lack intrinsic value – they are worth only what people are willing to pay for them【986811852637599†L84-L90】.</p>
      <p>Because no central authority guarantees repayment or manages supply, crypto prices are driven by supply and demand. Some see this decentralization as a benefit – offering freedom from government interference – while others worry about scams, hacks and the environmental impact of mining. As Investopedia notes, cryptocurrencies are secured by cryptography, which makes them extremely difficult to counterfeit, but their <em>price volatility</em>, high energy consumption and occasional use in illicit activities are significant downsides【559062347790685†L286-L306】.</p>
