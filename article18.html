        <h2>What Is Technical Analysis?</h2>
        <p>
          Technical analysis is the practice of using historical price and volume
          data to forecast future price movements. Unlike fundamental analysis,
          which examines an asset’s underlying value, technical analysis focuses
          on charts and statistics to identify patterns and trends【23783177852342†L330-L347】.
          The core assumption is that all available information is already
          reflected in the market price, so studying price action itself can
          reveal opportunities.【23783177852342†L401-L407】
        </p>
        <p>
          Technical analysts use two broad categories of tools: <em>chart
          patterns</em> and <em>technical indicators</em>. Chart patterns are
          visual formations (like triangles or head‑and‑shoulders) that suggest
          where prices might move next【23783177852342†L409-L416】. Technical
          indicators apply mathematical formulas to price and volume data to
          generate signals. Most traders combine several tools to confirm
          potential entry and exit points【23783177852342†L360-L367】.
        </p>
        <h2>Common Technical Indicators</h2>
        <h3>Moving Averages</h3>
        <p>
          A moving average smooths out price data by taking the average price
          over a specific period (for example, 20 days). Simple moving averages
          (SMAs) give equal weight to each data point, while exponential moving
          averages (EMAs) emphasize more recent prices. Traders often overlay
          two moving averages of different lengths and watch for crossovers: when
          a shorter moving average moves above a longer one, it can indicate
          upward momentum; when it drops below, it may signal a bearish trend.
          Moving averages are the most common technical indicators because they
          make trends easier to spot【23783177852342†L420-L423】.
        </p>
        <h3>MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence)</h3>
        <p>
          The MACD is a momentum oscillator that compares two EMAs of different
          lengths to gauge trend strength. It is calculated by subtracting a
          longer‑period EMA from a shorter‑period EMA. A signal line — itself an
          EMA of the MACD — is plotted on top, and a histogram shows the
          difference between the MACD and the signal line. Traders watch for
          “signal‑line crossovers”: when the MACD line crosses above its signal
          line, it may indicate a bullish shift; a cross below could suggest
          bearish momentum. Standard settings use 12‑, 26‑ and 9‑period EMAs【444043746761743†L152-L171】.
        </p>
        <h3>RSI (Relative Strength Index)</h3>
        <p>
          The RSI is a popular momentum oscillator introduced by J.&nbsp;Welles
          Wilder Jr. It measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes
          and oscillates between zero and 100. Readings above 70 typically
          indicate an asset is overbought, while values below 30 suggest it is
          oversold【473956463389719†L360-L392】. Traders often look for the RSI to
          cross back below 70 (from an overbought condition) or above 30 (from an
          oversold condition) as potential reversal signals【473956463389719†L390-L394】.
        </p>
        <h2>Combining Indicators and Recognizing Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          No single indicator is perfect. Many traders combine moving averages,
          MACD, RSI and chart patterns to build a more complete picture of
          market dynamics. Technical analysis also works best when combined with
          sound risk management. Remember that these tools are based on past
          price action, and past performance does not guarantee future results
          【23783177852342†L394-L397】. Markets can behave unpredictably; therefore,
          technical signals should be used alongside other research and a clear
          trading plan.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Technical analysis empowers traders to make data‑driven decisions by
          interpreting price charts and statistical indicators. By learning the
          basics of moving averages, MACD, RSI and chart patterns, you can begin
          to understand market psychology and spot potential entry and exit
          points. As with any trading strategy, discipline and continuous
          learning are key. Use technical analysis to complement other research
          methods, manage your risk carefully and stay adaptable as market
          conditions evolve.
